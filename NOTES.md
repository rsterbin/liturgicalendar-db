Answered questions from Fr Gerth --
* Is the change from white to gold for Annunciation an intentional change or a mistake that got carried from the previous year's transfer?
  * YES, this is correct
* The list of Commemorations needs confirmation, as there are some important variations from the Episcopal calendars I've found (e.g. http://satucket.com/lectionary/Calendar.htm)
  * Will review
* If a major feast falls on a Saturday in Lent, what happens to Stations of the Cross?
  * Omitted for a solemn mass; mass is dropped for regular feasts
* Was Ignatius of Loyola dropped from the calendar intentionally?
  * YES... but Fr. Smith sometimes does it anyway
* Confirm that The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary doesn't get transferred from Sunday, despite otherwise looking like a level 3
  * cORRECT, it would be transferred as usual
